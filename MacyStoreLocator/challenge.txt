Milo/eBay Recruiting Engineering Challenge

== Background ==
Many merchants expose in-store availability data to the web in a way that browsers can easily access,
but is often inconvenient for programs to parse. Rather than asking them to build a formal API,
it's usually easier to build directly to their web site.

== Problem ==
Write a program that accepts as its arguments, a ZIP code and a Macys.com offer URL
and will print the store availability for the closest 8 stores around the ZIP code centroid.

 For example:

./my_program 94403 "http://www.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=355333"

Macy's Hillsdale
115 Hillsdale Mall/ San Mateo, CA 94403
LIMITED

Macy's Hillsdale Furniture
2838 South El Camino Real/ San Mateo, CA 94403
AVAILABLE

Macy's Stanford
300 Stanford Mall/ Palo Alto, CA 94304
LIMITED

Macy's Serramonte
1 Serramonte Drive/ Daly City, CA 94105
NOT AVAILABLE

Macy's Southland
800 Southland Mall/ Hayward, CA 94545
NOT AVAILABLE

Macy's Bay Fair
15555 E. 14th Street / San Leandro , CA 94578
NOT AVAILABLE

Macy's Union City Furniture Clearance
1200 Whipple Road / Union City , CA 94587
NOT AVAILABLE

Macy's Stonestown Galleria
3251 20th Avenue / San Francisco , CA 94132
LIMITED

The precise output formatting is not important, so long as the store name, address, and
availability information are printed. You may use any programming language you wish.

If the URL given to your program is not for a locally available product, your program should
print a message describing the error and exit.

We will judge submissions based on these metrics:
  - Non-I/O CPU usage
  - Number of HTTP requests
  - End-to-end execution speed
  - Readability, structure, and error handling

== Bonus ==
To truly distinguish your submission, you can choose to handle product variations.
Most apparel products come in different sizes and colors, which are tracked as
different Stock-Keeping Units (SKUs), but represented as the same logical "product".
For a bonus, your program may optionally accept variational information on the
command line, and return the availability for that particular variation.
